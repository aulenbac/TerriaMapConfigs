# TerriaMap Catalogs
TerriaMap is a catalog-based web geospatial visualization platform. Geospatial data is specified via catalog configs referencing externally hosted geospatial data sets. Each application built with TerriaMap will need to define its own catalog.

Details on building catalogs are available at the [USGS TerriaMap Guide](https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/cdi/TerriaMap+Guide) and in the [Using a Catalog](https://docs.terria.io/guide/customizing/initialization-files/#using-a-catalog-file) section of [docs.terria.io](https://docs.terria.io/guide/). Docs.terrio.io is maintained by the developers of the open-source TerriaJS framework. Additional information on their work and community resources is available at their website [terria.io](https://terria.io/).

[SAS](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis) has deployed a [Common TerriaMap](http://maps.usgs.gov/map) which is intended to be used by a broad USGS community. The use cases currently supported include those where a user provide an init/catalog config file and/or adds their own data to the map.
